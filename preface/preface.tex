\begin{abstract}
  By using linear algebra, seeming different ``linear'' things in
  algebra, geometry, and calculus—things like systems of certain
  equations, rigid motions in geometry, certain differential
  equations—can be placed in a common framework of vectors, matrices,
  and linear transformations.  Viewing different things as somehow
  analogous provides not only insight, but also a common toolkit of
  surprisingly powerful algorithms.

This represents the first draft of the OSU Department of Mathematics'
online Linear Algebra course. The sections below includes everything
covered in the standard Math 2568 course, and a bit more. Later drafts
will incorporate additional topics from applied linear algebra and
differential equations.
