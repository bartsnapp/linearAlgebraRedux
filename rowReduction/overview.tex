\title{Row Reduction}

  We row reduce a matrix by performing row operations, in order to
  find a simpler but equivalent system for which the solution set is
  easily read off.

\maketitle

Given a system of equations, how can we find its solution set? The
answer is by finding a simpler but equivalent system for which the
solution set is easily read off. The method used for finding this
simpler system is called \dfn{row reduction}.
