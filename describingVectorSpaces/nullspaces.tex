If $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb R$, the {\it nullspace of A} is the set
\[
N(A) := \{{\bf x}\in\mathbb R^n\ |\ A*{\bf x} = {\bf 0}\}\subset \mathbb R^n
\]
In other words, $N(A)$ is the set of all solutions to the homogeneous matrix equation $A*{\bf x} = {\bf 0}$.

\begin{lemma} For any $m\times n$ matrix $A$ with entries in $\mathbb R$, $N(A)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Note that ${\bf 0}\in N(A)$. So we need to show that $N(A)$ satisfies the two closure axioms.

{\bf\underbar{C1}} Suppose ${\bf v}, {\bf w}\in N(A)$. Then
\[
A*({\bf v} + {\bf w}) = A*{\bf v} + A*{\bf w} = {\bf 0} + {\bf 0} = {\bf 0}
\]
Hence $N(A)$ is closed under addition.

{\bf\underbar{C2}} Suppose $\alpha\in\mathbb R$ and ${\bf v}\in N(A)$. Then
\[
A*(\alpha{\bf v}) = \alpha(A*{\bf v}) = \alpha{\bf 0} = {\bf 0} 
\]
Hence $N(A)$ is closed under scalar multiplication. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
