  The ``determinant'' summarizes how much a linear transformation,
  from a vector space to itself, ``stretches'' its input.

The determinant of a matrix exists whenever the matrix is square, and
whenever entries can be added and multiplied. Thus determinants exist
for more than just matrices of numbers; for example, a square matrix
whose entries are real-valued functions has a well-defined
determinant.

There are different ways to define it. We present two.
