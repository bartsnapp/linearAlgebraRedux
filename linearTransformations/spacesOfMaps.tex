Suppose $f$ and $g$ are linear transformations from $V$ to $W$.  Then the function
\[
  f + g : V \to W
\]
defined by the rule which sends $v \in V$ to $f(v) + g(v)$ is also a
linear transformation.

Similarly, if $f : V \to W$ is linear and $\alpha$ is a scalar, then
the function
\[
  \lambda f : V \to W
\]
defined by the rule $(\lambda f)(v) = \lambda f(v)$ is also a linear
transformation.

\begin{theorem} Suppose $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces.  The collection
  of linear transformations from $V$ to $W$ forms a vector space under
  the above operations.
\end{theorem}
